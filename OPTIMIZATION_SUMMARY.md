# Repository Optimization Summary

This repository has been optimized for Render deployment by removing unnecessary files while preserving all essential functionality.

## Files and Directories Removed

### Documentation Files
- Multiple language README files (README_*.md) - kept only main README.md
- Multiple language CONTRIBUTING files (CONTRIBUTING_*.md) - kept only main CONTRIBUTING.md
- Development documentation in `/images/` directory

### Development and Build Tools
- `/docker/` - Docker configuration not needed for Render
- `/dev/` - Development scripts and tools
- `/sdks/` - Client SDKs not needed for main application
- `.devcontainer/`, `.vscode/`, `.github/` - IDE and CI/CD configurations
- `Makefile` - Build automation not needed for Render

### Testing and Development Files
- All test files (`*.spec.ts`, `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.js`, `*.test.js`)
- Jest configuration files (`jest.config.ts`, `jest.setup.ts`)
- Development-only directories:
  - `web/__mocks__/`
  - `web/docker/`
  - `web/app/dev-only/`
  - `web/app/dev-preview/`
  - `api/docker/`
  - `api/tests/`
  - `web/.storybook/`
  - `web/.husky/`
  - `web/bin/`

### Configuration Files
- `mypy.ini`, `pytest.ini` - Python development tools
- `.editorconfig` - Editor configuration
- `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint configuration
- Development i18n tools (`auto-gen-i18n.js`, `check-i18n.js`)

## Files Added

### Deployment Configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Generated from `pyproject.toml` for easier Render deployment
- `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide for Render
- `.env.render.example` - Environment variable template for Render

## Code Changes

### API Service (`api/app.py`)
- Updated to use `PORT` environment variable instead of hardcoded port 5001
- Maintains binding to `0.0.0.0` as required by Render

### Web Service (`web/package.json`)
- Simplified start script to work better with Render's environment
- Removed custom PORT and HOSTNAME variables that could conflict with Render

## Render Compatibility

The repository now follows Render guidelines:
- ✅ API binds to `0.0.0.0` and uses `PORT` environment variable
- ✅ Web service uses Next.js standalone output for optimal performance
- ✅ Environment variables are properly configured for production deployment
- ✅ Build commands are optimized for Render's build environment

## Size Reduction

The optimization process has significantly reduced the repository size by removing:
- Development tools and configurations
- Test files and mock data
- Multiple language documentation
- Docker configurations
- IDE-specific files

## Preserved Functionality

All essential functionality has been preserved:
- Complete API backend (`/api/`)
- Complete web frontend (`/web/`)
- All runtime dependencies
- Configuration files needed for production
- Internationalization support
- All application features and components

The repository is now ready for deployment on Render with minimal configuration required.
